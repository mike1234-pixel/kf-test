## Project

This small prototype app fetches a list of sites, which the user can sort by name or size/power on the Portfolio/Home page. The user can click on a site to bring them to a Site page, which displays the site on a fullscreen map.

The projct is built with React and TypeScript.

## Data

I have returned data from custom hooks, along with loading and error states which mimic React Query. In a real-world scenario I would use this library, but I have followed its patterns here.

## Styling

I have used plain CSS to demonstrate my skills in the fundamentals. I have chosen CSS Modules as this helps in scoping CSS in frameworks like React.

The app is responsive down to 220px width screens.
